## üìñ Overview  

ChangeSim is an **AI-powered agent** that analyzes organizational changes and predicts their human impact.  
Instead of just mapping processes, ChangeSim highlights how shifts‚Äîlike a new CRM rollout‚Äîmay affect trust, training needs, and team resistance.  

- **Input**: Role/team + proposed change  
- **Output**: Plain-language impact notes (2‚Äì3 bullet points)  
- **Why it matters**: Leaders can anticipate challenges *before* rollout and communicate with empathy.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

1. Enter a **role/team** and a **proposed change**  
2. The agent calls an LLM via API with structured prompts  
3. Returns predicted human impacts as simple insights  
   - Example: *‚ÄúSales team may need retraining, expect resistance to leaving old CRM, plan training sessions for new features.‚Äù*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (generated via [v0.app](https://v0.app))  
- **Agent Logic**: Calls the OpenAI API with structured prompts (requires API key)  
- **Infrastructure**: Auto-synced from v0 ‚Üí GitHub for version control  
- **Hosting**: Currently local development; can be deployed to Vercel, or another host when ready  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: No live deployment yet ‚Äî this prevents unnecessary API usage charges.
