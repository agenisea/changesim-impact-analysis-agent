1. **Persistence Layer** (`lib/supabase-server.ts`, `lib/runs-store.ts`)
   - Full Supabase integration with proper RLS security
   - Automatic trace ID generation and correlation
   - Framework versioning for longitudinal research

2. **Tracing & Observability** (`lib/tracing-simple.ts`)
   - Event-level performance tracking
   - Error correlation and debugging
   - Research pipeline monitoring

3. **Dual-Mode Operation** (`app/api/analyze-impact/route.ts`)
   - **Basic Mode**: Fast, reliable organizational risk assessment
   - **Research Mode**: Deep principled analysis with multi-agent planning

4. **Security Architecture** (`docs/security.md`)
   - Row-level security with default deny policies
   - Environment-based secret management
   - Data minimization and anonymization strategies
