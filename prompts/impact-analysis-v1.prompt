# impact-analysis-v1.prompt
# defined: 2025-09-16

Simple agent that takes a one-line change description + org role/team, and generates a short impact note (2–3 bullet points).

Components
	1.	Agent

	•	Simple agent loop:
	•	Input: { role, change_description }
	•	Calls a Tool → OpenAI API with a structured prompt
	•	Returns a JSON response with:
{
“role”: “Sales Manager”,
“impact”: [“May need to retrain on CRM”, “Could resist due to lost productivity”]
}

	2.	Tool

	•	The “tool” here is a function: analyzeImpact(role, changeDescription) that wraps the API call.
	•	This makes it feel like a modular agent call, not just raw prompting.

	3.	UI (Next.js page)

	•	After login → a simple form
	•	Input 1: role/team name
	•	Input 2: proposed change (1–2 sentences)
	•	Button: “Analyze Impact”
	•	Output: bullet list of predicted impacts
