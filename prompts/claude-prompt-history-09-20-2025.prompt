This file contains all the prompts used during the codebase cleanup, optimization, and deterministic risk mapper implementation session.

Prompt 1: Code Quality Review and Cleanup
Review the current state of the impact analysis codebase and identify areas for improvement, including unused imports, dead code, and compliance with CLAUDE.md guidelines.

Prompt 2: Fix Missing Role and Change Description Display
Investigate why the Role, Change Description, and Risk Badge are no longer showing in the UI after recent changes. The meta data was not being included in API responses due to missing Zod schema fields.

Prompt 3: Improve Markdown Summary Generation
Enhance the system prompt to generate better structured and formatted markdown summaries for impact analysis reports. The current summaries were too short and not properly formatted.

Prompt 4: Extract LLM Prompts to Centralized File
Move all inline LLM prompts from the API route to a dedicated file at /components/agent/prompt.ts for better maintainability and organization.

Prompt 5: Upgrade Next.js and Dependencies
Upgrade the project to latest Next.js 15.x, React 19.x, and Zod 4.x to resolve ESLint compatibility issues and get latest features.

Prompt 6: Remove Dead Code and Unused Features
Remove the variants-branch feature and all related code (components, props, schema fields) as it was dormant infrastructure that was never being used.

Prompt 7: Fix Markdown Heading Rendering
Resolve issue where markdown headings (### Predicted Impacts, ### Risk Factors) were not rendering properly in ReactMarkdown component by adding custom component styling.

Prompt 8: Remove hasHighRiskKeywords Override Logic
Remove the hardcoded keyword-based risk level override system in favor of relying on improved AI prompt instructions for consistent risk assessment.

Prompt 9: Remove showHighRiskNotice UI Component
Clean up the high-risk notice UI component and all related props/logic as it was redundant with the existing risk badge system.

Prompt 10: Implement Deterministic Risk Mapper
Add a deterministic risk level mapping system with org-cap limitations following specific PDF requirements:
- Create lib/evaluator.ts with mapRiskLevel function
- Implement hard rules for critical/high/medium/low classification
- Add organizational scope cap (org-cap) for limited human impact scenarios
- Integrate with API route to override AI risk assessments
- Add human-readable decision trace notes when org-cap triggers

Summary of Session
This session focused on major codebase cleanup, modernization, and the implementation of a deterministic risk assessment system. Key accomplishments include:

1. **Code Quality**: Removed unused imports, dead code, and improved naming conventions
2. **Framework Updates**: Upgraded to Next.js 15, React 19, and resolved compatibility issues
3. **UI Improvements**: Fixed markdown rendering and removed redundant components
4. **Architecture Simplification**: Consolidated prompt management and removed unused features
5. **Risk Assessment Enhancement**: Implemented deterministic risk mapper with org-cap limitations
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized LLM prompts and improved code organization

The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and includes a robust deterministic risk assessment system that provides consistent, rule-based risk level classification.
