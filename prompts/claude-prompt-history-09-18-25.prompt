This file contains all the prompts used during the refactoring session.

Prompt 1: Initial Refactoring Request
> Context / Goal
  We have a Next.js (App Router) TypeScript project for "ChangeSim — Impact Analyzer." The current logic lives mostly in a single app/page.tsx. I want you to
  refactor it into:
      1.    shared types,
      2.    a client-side form component,
      3.    a presentational result component
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Target Structure
    •    types/impact.ts
    •    lib/analyzeImpact.ts
    •    analyzeImpact(input: ImpactInput): Promise<ImpactResult> that POSTs to /api/analyze-impact.
    •    components/ImpactForm.tsx (client)
    •    Props: initial?: ImpactInput, onSubmit: (input: ImpactInput) => Promise<void> | void, busy?: boolean
    •    Contains fields for Role/Team and Proposed Change, calls onSubmit.
    •    components/ImpactResult.tsx
    •    Props: { result: ImpactResult | null }
    •    Renders a simple list of bullets.
    •    app/page.tsx (or app/impact/page.tsx)
    •    Client component that wires form → analyzeImpact → result display
    •    Handles loading and error states

Prompt 2: File Naming Convention Request
I would like to rename these files so that they are respectfully named: impact-form.tsx | impact-result.tsx | analyze-impact.ts -> '/Users/patrickpena/Projects/changesim-impact-analysis-agent/components/ImpactForm.tsx''/Users/patrickpena/Projects/changesim-impact-analysis-agent/components/ImpactResult.tsx''/Users/patrickpena/Projects/changesim-impact-analysis-agent/lib/analyzeImpact.ts'
Prompt 3: Development Guidelines Request
Can you add a claude.md that specifies to kebab-case and a similar modular convention when adding new features and components going forward?

Prompt 4: Package Manager Update Request
can you update claude.md so that has examples for pnpm and not npm?

Prompt 5: File Comparison Request
Please explain the difference between these two files and where else they are used in the app: '/Users/patrickpena/Projects/changesim-impact-analysis-agent/lib/analyze-impact.ts''/Users/patrickpena/Projects/changesim-impact-analysis-agent/lib/impact-agent.ts'

Prompt 6: Function Naming Clarification Request
Please rename them appropriately so that they make sense. To me it doesn't make sense that they both have a function with the same name.

Prompt 7: Commit Strategy Request
I like all the changes and things are working great. But I won't to break all the changes down into at least 2 concise commits. What files should I include in each commit? What commit message should I use for each?

Prompt 8: Three-Commit Strategy Request
Could I actually break it down to 3 committs for better clarity

Prompt 9: Commit Format Documentation Request
Can you add the commit format to the Claude.md so when you're prompted for a commit message for the changes you'll be able to refer to how we should do it going forward?

Prompt 10: Session Documentation Request
Can you now create a new file called /prompts/claude-prompt-history-09-18-25.prompt and fill it with all the prompts I have used in this session so far?

Prompt 11: File Format Update Request
I don't need the contents of the file to be in markdown format but please add the name of the file at the top followed by a line that contains the date in mm/dd/yyyy format

Prompt 12: Commit Format Documentation Request
Can you add the commit format to the Claude.md so when you're prompted for a commit message for the changes you'll be able to refer to how we should do it going forward?

Prompt 13: Prompt History Guidelines Request
I updated the file with the format I like. Can you add information to claude.md so that when instructed you'll log all the prompts from the current session into a new prompt file following the naming convention and format of the current claude-prompt-history-09-18-2025.prompt file?

Prompt 14: Update Current History File Request
can you update the current claude prompt history file with all the prompts made in the current session?

Summary of Session
This session focused on refactoring a monolithic Next.js page into a modular, well-organized codebase with:
- Shared TypeScript types
- Modular UI components
- Clear separation between client-side and server-side logic
- Consistent kebab-case naming conventions
- Comprehensive development guidelines
- Structured commit strategy documentation
- Prompt history documentation system
